# Immediate Next Steps

1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install` at the repo root to hydrate frontend/backend workspaces.
   - `python -m venv .venv && pip install -r ai/requirements.txt` for AI service.
2. Configure tooling:
   - Add ESLint/Prettier for frontend; set up Jest/Vitest for unit tests.
   - Wire up backend testing (Jest or Vitest) and integration test harness.
   - Configure Ruff/Black for AI code quality.
3. Implement module stubs:
   - Frontend: routing shell, auth guard placeholders, shared UI kit baseline.
   - Backend: auth middleware scaffold, UAE Pass OAuth client, MongoDB connection.
   - AI: dataset ingestion pipeline skeleton and transcription service interface.
4. DevOps & compliance readiness:
   - Add Docker Compose for local orchestration (web, api, ai, mongo).
   - Document environment variables and secrets management approach.
   - Define security baseline (lint rules, dependency scanning, IaC guardrails).
